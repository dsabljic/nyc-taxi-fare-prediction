# NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to accurately predict New York City taxi fares using various features such as pickup and dropoff coordinates, passenger count, day of the week, and hour of the ride. The model focuses on enhancing the accuracy of fare estimation by including engineered features like travel distance and distances from major airports (JFK, LaGuardia, Newark). XGBoost Regressor (XGBRegressor) is used for training and prediction. The model was serialized using the pickle module for [deployment](https://dsabljic-nyc-taxi-fare-prediction-app-4w64qw.streamlitapp.com/).
